# TW5
* a test TW5 file was uploaded, but I do not seem to be able to activate it.
* perhaps is needs to be 'index'html' ?

Whilst trying to sort out the hosting issues, I am proceding to enhance the version of the TwFive file that will be uploded.
* Next, I will need to evolve an efficient workFlow
